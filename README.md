# COMP123 - Programming II

This repository contains my work for the Programming II course (COMP-123) at Centennial College. In this course, I learned how to develop object-oriented programs using C#. The assignments and projects in this repository demonstrate my understanding of core OOP principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, as well as advanced features like file handling, exception management, and GUI development.

Key Concepts Covered:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals
- Creating and using classes, objects, and constructors
- Inheritance and polymorphism with abstract classes and interfaces
- Exception handling and managing errors in C#
- File handling and data persistence using serialization and deserialization
- Designing and implementing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using Windows Forms
- Test-Driven Development and working with collections
  
This repository showcases my skills in designing, coding, and documenting C# programs for both console-based and Windows applications.
